# Waterline

An elegant UI for monitoring [Laravel Workflows](https://github.com/laravel-workflow/laravel-workflow).

## Installation

This UI is installable via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```bash
composer require laravel-workflow/waterline

php artisan waterline:install
```

## Authorization

Waterline exposes a dashboard at the `/waterline` URL. By default, you will only be able to access this dashboard in the local environment. However, within your `app/Providers/WaterlineServiceProvider.php` file, there is an authorization gate definition. This authorization gate controls access to Waterline in non-local environments.

```
Gate::define('viewWaterline', function ($user) {
    return in_array($user->email, [
        'admin@example.com',
    ]);
});
```

This will allow only the single admin user to access the Waterline UI.


## Upgrading Waterline

After upgrading Waterline you must publish the latest assets.

```bash
composer require laravel-workflow/waterline

php artisan waterline:publish
```
